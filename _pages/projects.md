> Our team designed a high-performance and power-efficient FPGA implementation for CNN inference, which includes an adder-tree-based computational unit tailored for the Tiny-YOLO v3 model and a datapath that minimizes buffer usage while maximizing computational parallelism, effectively optimizing performance within the constraints of limited on-chip memory. </p> 
> 
> <p><b>Remarks</b> <br>
> Our team presented in a special session at <a href="https://aicas2022.org/?page_id=188">IEEE AICAS 2022</a> and secured 2nd place out of 111 teams, winning a $2,000 prize. </p>

> <img src='/images/CarMaker.webp'/> <br>
> This competition is organized by Hyundai Motor and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students in Korea. The preliminary round takes place in the CarMaker simulation environment, where participants undertake various tasks such as dynamic obstacle avoidance, static obstacle avoidance, traffic light handling, and lane-keeping. The final round retains similar missions but is conducted using modified real vehicles. </p> 
> 
> <p><b>Details</b> <br>
> I developed software to execute various missions in the CarMaker simulation, contributing to the development of object detection through a modified version of YOLO v3, object tracking using Kalman Filter with lidar and camera, and implementing an Optimal Frenet Planning algorithm for path planning (available on <a href="https://vdcl.snu.ac.kr/members/professor">GitHub</a>). </p> 
> 
> <p><b>Remarks</b> <br>
> Our team participated in this competition up to the preliminary round after passing the document screening. The entire process of the project was carried out under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://vdcl.snu.ac.kr/members/professor">Kyongsu Yi</a> at Seoul National University. </p>

> <p><b>Project Description</b> <br>
> This competition is an undergraduate contest organized by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of South Korea. It involves various tasks such as static obstacle avoidance, dynamic obstacle avoidance, traffic light recognition, parking, and curve driving. Awards are given to the teams that complete all missions in the shortest amount of time. This competition encompasses everything from building a platform capable of autonomous driving to developing the autonomous driving software itself. </p>

> I served as the Deputy Team Leader for the entire project and concurrently held the position of Team Leader for the Vision Team. The project was conducted at the Future Mobility Technology Center (FMTC) at Seoul National University. Our team implemented an autonomous driving platform using two cameras, one LiDAR, one GPS, and one IMU. We developed a comprehensive autonomous driving algorithm that includes HD map creation, localization, path-planning, object detection and vision algorithms. I developed autonomous driving software, focusing particularly on real-time parking slot detection using a modified version of YOLO v3, traffic light detection with YOLO v3, and lane detection utilizing the LaneNet algorithm.
