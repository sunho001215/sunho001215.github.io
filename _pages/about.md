<br/>
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and System Semiconductor Engineering for AI from Seoul National University. Currently, I'm fulfilling my civic duty by serving as a social service agent, an alternative to traditional military service in South Korea. My academic interests span a range of topics including robotics, autonomous driving, real-time systems, and cyber-physical systems, with a particular focus on system safety. I am currently wishing to study abroad for a Ph.D. Degree.

A condensed version of my CV is also available [here](http://sunho001215.github.io/files/sk-cv.pdf).
